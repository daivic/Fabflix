Everett and I worked together a lot in person, so it was easy to delegate and work on things individualy. We spent most of the time understanding the setup thouroughly, and since we both wanted to learn, we set up multiple instances of everything. Some issues we encountered all had to do with setup of environment. For example, we had to SET GLOBAL sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY','')); because some settings in mysql were wrong. Overall, we learned a lot about the different tools that are used and are excited to continue learning.
